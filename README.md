## Getting Started

First, clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Juandlc25/e-commerce-meru.git
```

go to the folder

```bash
cd e-commerce-meru
```

install the dependencies

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Difficulties

- For some reason the images did not work for me, I realized that the link to them did not have access to be displayed, it gave me the 403 error. But I got all the functionality
